# Note: File descriptors vs filepaths
# After creating a shared memory block, we need to be able to reference that
# block of memory and share it between processes. We could remove the file
# immediately so we don't leave cruft hanging around on the filesystem,
# and do just fine sharing the file descriptor with other processes. This
# approach relies on sending file descriptors over UNIX domain sockets. This
# sounds annoying and requires some extra code. It's probably the right
# solution so it'll happen eventually.
# The alternate approach is simply to share a filepath. This has the
# disadvantage that the file will remain on the filesystem if the process dies
# without running the corresponding clean up code.
