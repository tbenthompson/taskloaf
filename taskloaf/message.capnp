# Unions are probably kind of slow, but...

# TODO: A multi-part message design would allow getting rid of the union and
# using a separate message part for the typeCode and sourceName and then a
# user-defined message for the remainder, to be decoded by the deserializer
# specified by typeCode
# TODO: This seems especially cool in the context of a system where Capnp
# objects underlie most of the system so that no serialization needs to happen
# for a lot of messaging requirements.
# TODO: is there any kind of capnp <--> zmq interface? A buffer interface?
